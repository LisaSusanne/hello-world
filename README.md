# hello-world

Hi everyone
I'm am a curious data analyst/project manager that via my work has spent a lot of time with GitHub, Azure and Power BI. 
I now want to pick up on these areas in the methodical way as weel as getting more familiar with R coding since I primarily have been using SQl and Hive. 
I have many thoughts and ideas that I hope to converting into real projects and results.
I'll get back:-)
